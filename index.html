		<h1>Travian++ - A Google Chrome extension for Travian</h1>
		<h2>Features</h2>
		<p>Currently the travian++ extension has the following features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A farmlist</li>
			<li>Graphs visualising the prognosed resourcelevels</li>
			<li>A more sophisticated village overview</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Farmlist</h3>
		<p>
			Initially the farmlist will be empty. On any village page, i.e. a page 
			with <code>position_details.php</code> in the address, an extra link is 
			added:
		</p>
		<img src="addfarm.png">
		<p>
			If you click on this link, the village page is bookmarked on the 
			resources page:
		</p>
		<img src="farmlist.png">
		<p>
			Note that the farmlist is synchronised with your other Google Chrome
			instances. So whether you are behind your laptop or desktop computer,
			you will see the same list.
		</p>
		<h3>Graph</h3>
		<p>
			The Graph will show the resource levels in the near future (24 hours)
			of each village. It can be found by navigating to 
			<code>Statistics -&gt; User -&gt; Grafiek</code>.
			The graph is based on the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Current resource levels</li>
			<li>Growth</li>
			<li>Incoming merchants</li>
			<li>Incoming troops</li>
		</ul>
		<img src="graph.png">
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>
			The overview page adds some usefull icons. It shows troop movements of
			all your villages and indicates which villages are building and which are
			not.  All icons will automatically change when troops arrive or when work
			has finished.
